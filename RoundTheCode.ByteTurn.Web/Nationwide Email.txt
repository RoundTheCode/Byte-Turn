This is in regards to mortgage application M563153623.

1. I am buying the property of my sister. Normally what happens is that when you are buying a property and you have a property to sell, the seller's estate agents will ring up the buyer's estate agents to ensure that the buyer has a seller on-board for their property. As she is buying it through me, we are avoiding the estate agents. How can she go about proving that she has a seller on-board?

2. I am looking to get a new job in the near-future. The job role will be very similar to my current job role, but would be with another company. I would only change my job for a pay increase. How would this affect my chances of getting a mortgage if I was to get a new job during the mortgage application process?
